# Private Search Service Repository 
This repository contains three projects aimed at providing a secure private search service. The projects include:
  1. jpir Project (jpir_new):
     Initially an open-source Java application, the jpir project has been               customized to incorporate specific decryption methods. It serves as the            foundation for the private search functionality.
  2. Private Search Service (PIR-project):
     Developed using Java with Spring Boot, this project enables encrypted product     searches while implementing user and admin roles. It offers functionalities        such as login and registration, secure product search, search history viewing,     product and user management, and more.
  3. pir-react-front:
     This project serves as the frontend for the backend private search service.       Built using JavaScript and React, it facilitates user interaction with the        private search service.

# Running the services:

1. jpir Project (jpir_new):
  - Navigate to the jpir project directory. 
  - Execute mvn clean install in the terminal to generate a JAR file.
